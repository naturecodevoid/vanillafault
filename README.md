# DsPvPv2

A Minecraft resource pack based on default textures, for everyone.

This pack was originally made by [disomocan7](https://twitter.com/disomocan7), and I got it from
https://mcpedl.com/dspvp-pack/. The version I downloaded is very outdated compared to the official mcpedl version. Sub
to his YT channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JyequQqNbgX4uEPPBJFJg?sub_confirmation=1) :heart:

## Installing

### Java edition/windows 10 edition

[Download this repository](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/archive/master.zip) and run:

-   Mac or Linux
    -   `sh ./install-java.sh` - For java edition (Minecraft Java Editon)
-   Windows
    -   `install-bedrock.cmd` - For bedrock edition (Minecraft Windows 10 Edition)
    -   `install-java.cmd` - For java edition (Minecraft Java Editon)

The latest release should also be at https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/releases/latest. You can get `.mcpack`
files (for bedrock edition) there, and `.zip` files for both platforms.

**If you are on a version lower than 1.14 & play on java edition, I recommend getting the
[1.14 textures](https://hypixel.net/threads/texture-pack-1-14-block-item-textures-for-1-8-now-with-connected-block-textures.2190166/)
or downloading them
[here](<https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/raw/master/1.14%20Textures%20for%201.8%20(With%20Connected).zip>).**

### Bedrock edition

The pack should work on mobile (aka MCPE, Minecraft Pocket Edition, Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Minecraft).

You can download and open the `.mcpack` file from the
[latest release](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/releases/latest) on mobile or any other bedrock edition
platform to auto-install.

You can also get the `.mcpack` file from the
[`out` directory](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/tree/master/out). Look for
`DsPvPv2 {version} Bedrock.mcpack`, or similar.

If you can't get the `.mcpack` file or I haven't put it up, you can also
[download this repository](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/archive/master.zip), unzip it, and copy the files
in `pack/assets/minecraft` to your [game files](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Com.mojang). **This is for advanced
users _only_**.

### Java edition manual install

Download the `.zip` file from https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/releases/latest, and put it in your
[resource packs directory](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack#Java_Edition).

The `.zip` file may not be put up on the releases page, so you can use [this method](#installing) to install on java
edition.

You can also get the `.zip` file from the [`out` directory](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/tree/master/out).
Look for `DsPvPv2 {version} Java.zip`, or similar.

## Versions

-   Short swords
-   Long swords
-   Short Swords and Short Guards

-   Henry's 1.14 default edit Swords (swords by
    [henrypacks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzw0If_gEbjJHkpwrvDFrJw) :heart:)
-   Azula Swords (swords by [keno on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoLVr95y1SRxmvXDr-s-nqg) :heart:)

[This method](#installing) installs both versions. If you are downloading from release or the
[`out` directory](https://github.com/naturecodevoid/DsPvPv2/tree/master/out), look for
`DsPvPv2 {version} {platform}.[mcpack or zip]`.

## Help

### (Java edition) It says "this resource pack might not work in this Minecraft version!" (or something similar)

The resource pack should work in all versions. I have tested it in Minecraft versions 1.8.9, 1.14, and 1.15 on Badlion
Client (Badlion shouldn't make a difference, though). The only reason this happens is because I specified the minecraft
version in the pack to be 1.8 or below. The pack should still work on 1.8+.
